# Documentation Style Guide - Stoic Citadel

## 1. Overview
Consistency is key to professional documentation. This guide defines the standards for all documentation within the Stoic Citadel project.

## 2. Tone and Voice
- **Professional & Technical:** Use clear, concise, and objective language.
- **Action-Oriented:** Start instructions with imperative verbs (e.g., "Run the script," "Configure the parameter").
- **Audience-Aware:** Tailor the depth of technical detail to the specific section (e.g., Tutorials vs. API Reference).

## 3. Formatting Standards
- **Markdown:** All documentation must be written in Markdown (`.md`).
- **Headings:** Use ATX-style headings (`#`, `##`, `###`). Avoid skipping levels.
- **Code Blocks:** Always specify the language for syntax highlighting (e.g., ```python).
- **File Paths:** Use backticks for file paths and directory names (e.g., `src/strategies/`).
- **Variables:** Use backticks for configuration keys and environment variables (e.g., `DRY_RUN`).

## 4. Structure (Diátaxis Framework)
We follow the Diátaxis documentation framework:
1.  **Tutorials (Learning-oriented):** Lessons that take the beginner by the hand through a series of steps.
2.  **How-To Guides (Problem-oriented):** Practical steps to achieve a specific real-world goal.
3.  **Reference (Information-oriented):** Technical descriptions of the machinery and how to operate it.
4.  **Explanation (Understanding-oriented):** Background material that provides context and deeper insight.

## 5. Visuals
- Use **Mermaid.js** for diagrams where possible.
- Ensure screenshots are high-quality and cropped to show only the relevant area.

## 6. Language
- Primary language: **English**.
- Translations (e.g., Russian) should be kept in sync with the English version.
